          <h5><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Important Note</h5>
          <p class="mb-0">There isn't really an objective answer to choosing which state ID to get. The main rule to follow is do not get a fake of the state you live in/ go to school in. Bouncers, clerks, etc. see hundreds of in-state ID's every week. Even the slightest differences in a fake will be noticeable to them.</p>
